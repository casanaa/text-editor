# text-editor

As A developer

I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection

So that I can reliably retrieve them for later use

Given a text editor web application

When I open my application in my editor

Then I should see a client server folder structure

When I run `npm run start` from the root directory

Then I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

When I run the text editor application from my terminal

Then I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

When I run my webpack plugins

Then I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

When I use next-gen JavaScript in my application

Then I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

When I open the text editor

Then I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window

Then I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

When I reopen the text editor after closing it

Then I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

When I click on the Install button

Then I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

When I load my web application

Then I should have a registered service worker using workbox

When I register a service worker

Then I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

When I deploy to Render

THhen I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
